# Surface_anomaly_detection_using_unsupervised_algorithms
Hi, this is a project that has been done to implement some unsupervised algorhimgs for "Anomaly Detection" or "Surface Anomaly Detection" problem on an image dataset with image sizes: 128*128*3.


4 different methodes are implemented for this purpose and the result of them are evaluated by AUROC and AP techniques to identify the best one.


The first algorithm is a VAE (Varitional Autoencoer)


the second one is a regular autoencoder.


the third one is OCSVM(One-Class Support Vector Machine)


and finally the last algorithm is Isolation Forest.
